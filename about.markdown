Hi there, I'm Evan Sanderson-Movius, and I'm an engineering manager, bird aficionado, and generally a genial and earnest young lad. Will this blog contain more content about birds than software development? Only time will tell.

If you're reading this, awesome! If you're not, then we've entered some troubling metaphysical territory.
