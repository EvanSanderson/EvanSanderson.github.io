Hi there, I'm Evan! I'm an engineering manager, bird aficionado, and DC resident. There's occasionally things I want to write about - mostly to help me format my own thinking, but also to share with people like you. Will this blog contain more content about birds than software development? Only time will tell.

If you're reading this, awesome and welcome! If you're not, then we've entered some troubling metaphysical territory.
